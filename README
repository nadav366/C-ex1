Software structure-
I divided the realization so that the main function activates, by steps, the functions that handle
 only a certain part, and finally some auxiliary functions for specific tasks.
The steps are-
- Receiving and testing an array from the user.
- Getting the number of convolutions.
- Centering
- Normalization
- Making the convolution
- Histogram printing
Auxiliary Functions-
- Convolution parameterization
- Convert string to number

Exercise Details-
- All arrays are configured and initialized in the main function to make it easier to run different
 functions on them.
- Because all numbers are invalid with no chips I chose about -1 to mark an invalid return value.
- The conjunction works at run time of O (n ^ 2) because for each place t there is a run on all
  possible m's.
